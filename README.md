# Hydrologic_station_data_view
This code offers an easy way to visualize hydrological data from multiple rain gauges and streamflow stations. The input data must be at the daily scale. The code provides time-related distribution plots and classic statistical tests.

The code was fitted to rainfall and streamflow data from the dataset published with the DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1669671. This dataset is part of the data paper entitled "Rainfall, Streamflow, and Groundwater Dataset from a Hydrogeological Complex Basin in Northeastern SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil", which was submitted to the Earth System Science Data (ESSD) journal.
