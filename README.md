# Hydrologic_station_data_view
This code provides a simple way to visualize hydrological information from multiple rain gauges and streamflow station data. The input data must be at the daily scale. The code provides time-related distribution plots and classic statistical tests.

It was fitted to rainfall and streamflow data from the dataset published with the DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1669671. The dataset is part of the Data Paper, intitled "Rainfall, Streamflow, and Groundwater Dataset from a Hydrogeological Complex Basin in Northeastern SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil", submitted to the Earth System Science Data (ESSD) journal.
